# HammerFit-py

**Version 0.0.1**

HammerFit-py is a Python interface designed for accessing and reading Hammer reweighted histograms. It integrates Hammer's degrees of freedom (Wilson Coefficients and Form Factor parameters) into Pythonic fitting frameworks, such as iMinuit, specifically for semileptonic studies.

The model's definition is contained in a JSON file, where the paths to the files containing the histograms (e.g., `.dat` files for Hammer-reweighted histograms and `.root` files for non-Hammer-reweighted histograms) are defined. The JSON file also includes all necessary properties to perform fits and generate plots.

### Features:
- Access and read Hammer reweighted histograms.
- Integrate Hammer's Wilson Coefficients and Form Factor parameters into Pythonic fitting interfaces.
- Designed for semileptonic studies, enabling easy fits and visualizations.
